### Jarvis
 
Greetings Sir/Ma'am, I am Jarvis. 

## Description

Okay, not the actual J.A.R.V.I.S made by Tony Stark, but a simplified version of it. Somewhere along my family tree are my more famous cousins Siri and Alexa.

As huge fan of the MCU, I drew inspiration from Tony Stark's arsenal of technology. While I may not have the ability to build a functional Iron Man suit (yet), it is within my skillset to build Jarvis, ableit an extremely simplified version (Unfortunately, I cannot change nuclear launch codes as seen in Avengers: Rise of Ultron).

## ToDo
- [x] Create speech engine
- [x] Create listener to listen to user voice commands
- [ ] Perform simple information retrieval tasks (i.e. weather, time, location, etc)
- [ ] Perform non-intrusive tasks on local machine (i.e. open application, play music, etc)
- [ ] Expand database of phrases
- [ ] Implement Docker (? tbd)
- [ ] Obtain the mind stone to make Jarvis sentient
